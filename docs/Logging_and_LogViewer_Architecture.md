# **1. Overview**

The Langkit logging architecture is a high-performance system engineered to solve UI performance degradation during high-volume data processing operations. It provides detailed, real-time feedback to the user without overwhelming the frontend, while simultaneously ensuring that a complete and unabridged log history is preserved for debugging and crash reporting.

## **1.1. Core Purpose and Design Philosophy**

The system is built on a foundation of several key principles derived from the challenges of processing large media files:

*   **UI Responsiveness:** The primary goal is to prevent the user interface from freezing or becoming unresponsive, even when thousands of log and progress events are generated per second.
*   **Absolute Data Integrity:** No log data is ever discarded. Every event must be captured and available for post-mortem analysis, ensuring that debugging reports are complete and accurate.
*   **Robustness and Concurrency:** The architecture is designed to be thread-safe on the backend and resilient to race conditions on the frontend. It gracefully handles conflicts between automated UI updates and direct user interaction.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** The system includes performance optimizations, such as WebAssembly (Wasm) integration, that significantly improve processing speed on supported platforms but are not required for core functionality. The application remains fully operational without these enhancements.

## **1.2. The Dual-Path Approach: UI vs. Crash Reporting**

To balance performance with the need for complete diagnostic data, the system employs a dual-path architecture immediately at the point of log generation within the backend `GUIHandler`. This is achieved using a `zerolog.MultiLevelWriter`.

1.  **The Data Integrity Path:** All log events are immediately formatted into a human-readable format and written to an in-memory `bytes.Buffer`. This buffer serves as a complete, unfiltered record of the session. It is not subject to any throttling and is used exclusively for generating comprehensive debug and crash reports via the `crash.WriteReport` function.

2.  **The UI Update Path:** Simultaneously, the raw JSON representation of each log event is sent to the `AdaptiveEventThrottler`. This path is heavily optimized for UI performance. Events are intelligently buffered, batched, and throttled based on their frequency and criticality before being broadcast to the frontend. This ensures the UI receives updates at a manageable rate, preventing thread saturation.

## **1.3. Key Challenges Addressed**

This architecture was specifically designed to overcome several critical challenges inherent in real-time logging for processing-intensive applications:

*   **UI Saturation:** The primary challenge is preventing the frontend's main thread from being blocked by an overwhelming firehose of individual WebSocket events. The system solves this through adaptive batching in the `AdaptiveEventThrottler`.
*   **Performance vs. Completeness:** A naive solution to UI saturation would be to drop events. The dual-path model elegantly resolves this conflict by separating the concerns: one path preserves everything for diagnostics, while the other optimizes for a fluid user experience.
*   **Chronological Ordering:** Due to asynchronous processing and batching, events can arrive at the frontend out of their original order. The system addresses this by enriching every log message with a monotonic `_sequence` number and a `_unix_time` millisecond timestamp, allowing the frontend `logStore` to reconstruct a perfectly sorted timeline.


# **2. High-Level Architectural Flow**

The logging system is a multi-stage pipeline that processes events from their point of origin in the Go backend to their final rendered state in the Svelte frontend. This flow is designed to decouple high-frequency event generation from the performance-sensitive UI rendering layer.

## **2.1. Component Diagram: Backend to Frontend**

The diagram below illustrates the journey of a log event through the system's primary components.

## **2.2. The WebSocket Bridge: Real-time Event Communication**

The backend and frontend communicate asynchronously via an event-driven WebSocket bridge, provided by the Wails framework and abstracted through a `WebsocketService` interface. The `AdaptiveEventThrottler` is the primary user of this bridge for logging.

*   **Batched Events:** To minimize communication overhead and reduce the number of context switches on the frontend, the throttler primarily sends events in batches. The two key event names are:
    *   `log-batch`: Carries an array of log message objects.
    *   `progress-batch`: Carries an array of progress update objects.
*   **Direct Events:** For high-priority events that must bypass the throttling mechanism (e.g., critical errors), the throttler can send a single log via the `log.entry` event.

This batching strategy is a cornerstone of the system's performance, transforming a potential flood of thousands of small messages into a controlled stream of larger, more efficient data packets.

## **2.3. Roles of Key Components**

*   **`GUIHandler` (`internal/core/handler.go`):**
    *   **Role:** The primary entry point for all UI-related events in the backend.
    *   **Function:** It implements the `MessageHandler` interface. When a log or progress update is generated, it immediately forwards the event to the `AdaptiveEventThrottler` for processing. It also acts as the final broadcaster, implementing the `WebsocketService` to send the throttled event batches to the frontend.

*   **`AdaptiveEventThrottler` (`internal/pkg/batch/throttler.go`):**
    *   **Role:** The performance gatekeeper and central nervous system of the backend logging pipeline.
    *   **Function:** It receives a high-volume stream of individual events from the `GUIHandler`. Using a thread-safe, command-based model, it analyzes the incoming event rate, buffers events, and adaptively adjusts its emission frequency. Its output is a controlled, batched stream of events ready for the frontend.

*   **`logStore` (`internal/gui/frontend/src/lib/logStore.ts`):**
    *   **Role:** The reactive state management hub for all logs on the frontend.
    *   **Function:** It listens for `log-batch` events from the backend. It performs a secondary micro-batching of its own to coalesce rapid updates. Its core responsibility is to merge new logs into the existing log array while maintaining perfect chronological order using the `mergeInsertLogs` function, which can be accelerated by WebAssembly.

*   **`LogViewer` (`internal/gui/frontend/src/components/LogViewer.svelte`):**
    *   **Role:** The final rendering and user interaction component.
    *   **Function:** It reactively subscribes to the `logStore`. It is responsible for efficiently rendering the logs to the DOM, managing user interactions like scrolling and filtering, and implementing performance techniques such as virtualization to handle massive log lists without degrading UI responsiveness.
    
    
# **3. Backend Logging Pipeline: From Generation to Broadcast**

The backend pipeline is responsible for capturing, processing, and intelligently broadcasting events to the frontend. It is designed for high throughput and thread safety, ensuring that intense logging activity does not impact the core processing tasks of the application.

## **3.1. Log Origination: The `GUIHandler` and `zerolog` Integration**

All UI-bound logging originates within the `GUIHandler` (`internal/core/handler.go`). This component serves as a centralized event handler for both the command-line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI).

The logging infrastructure is built upon the `rs/zerolog` library. In `NewGUIHandler`, a `zerolog.MultiLevelWriter` is configured to implement the dual-path architecture:

1.  **Crash Report Path (`bufferWriter`):** A `zerolog.ConsoleWriter` writes formatted, human-readable logs directly into an in-memory `bytes.Buffer`. This path is simple, direct, and preserves all log data for diagnostics.
2.  **UI Path (`guiLogWriter`):** A custom `io.Writer` implementation, `LogWriter`, is used. This writer does not format the logs; instead, it receives the raw JSON output from `zerolog` and passes it as a string to the `AdaptiveEventThrottler` via `throttler.AddLog(string(p))`. This preserves the structured log data for efficient processing on the frontend.

This setup ensures that every call to `h.logger.Info().Msg("...")` or similar `zerolog` methods automatically routes the log event down both paths simultaneously.

## **3.2. The `AdaptiveEventThrottler`: Central Command Processor**

The `AdaptiveEventThrottler` (`internal/pkg/batch/throttler.go`) is the core of the backend's performance strategy. It prevents the `GUIHandler` from directly flooding the WebSocket connection.

### **3.2.1. The Command-Based Concurrency Model**

To eliminate race conditions and the need for complex mutex locking, the throttler's state is managed exclusively by a single goroutine, the `processCommands` loop. All public methods (`AddLog`, `UpdateProgress`, `Shutdown`, etc.) do not modify state directly. Instead, they encapsulate the operation and its arguments into a `command` struct and send it to a buffered channel (`commandChan`).

The `processCommands` goroutine runs a continuous `select` loop, processing one command at a time from the channel in a strictly sequential order. This single-writer model guarantees that all state modifications—such as appending to buffers, updating rate counters, and managing timers—are inherently thread-safe.

### **3.2.2. Buffering and Adaptive Throttling Logic**

When a command like `addLogCommand` is executed, the throttler makes an intelligent decision based on its current state:

1.  **Critical Log Check:** The log's JSON content is parsed to check for error levels and specific "behavior" fields like `abort_all`. If deemed critical, it is emitted immediately, bypassing all throttling.
2.  **Rate Calculation:** The throttler maintains a sliding time window (`eventTimeWindow`) of recent event timestamps to calculate the current event rate (events per second).
3.  **Direct Pass-Through:** If the event rate is below a configurable threshold (`directPassThreshold`, default: 20 events/sec) and the system is not in "high-load mode," the event is sent directly to the frontend without being buffered. This provides low latency during periods of low activity.
4.  **Buffering:** If the event rate is high, the log string is appended to the `logBuffer`, and progress updates are merged into the `progressBuffer` map (which stores only the latest state for each progress bar ID).

### **3.2.3. High-Load Mode and Periodic Flushes**

*   **High-Load Mode:** If the event rate exceeds a high threshold (100 events/sec) or is manually enabled (e.g., during task resumption), the throttler enters "high-load mode." In this state, it bypasses adaptive timing and forces a fixed, longer interval between flushes (`maxInterval`), maximizing batch sizes. This mode can be activated with a timeout, after which it automatically reverts to normal adaptive behavior.
*   **Periodic Flushes:** To guarantee that the UI receives updates even during lulls in high-frequency event streams, a `time.NewTicker` runs in the `processCommands` loop. Every 250 milliseconds, it checks if the buffers contain any pending events and triggers a flush if they do.

## **3.3. The Dual-Path Broadcast**

When the `doFlush` method is called (triggered by the adaptive logic or the periodic ticker), the buffered events are sent to the frontend via the `WebsocketService` broadcaster.

### **3.3.1. Critical Logs: Immediate, Direct Emission (`log.entry`)**

As identified in step 3.2.2, critical logs are not buffered. The `addLogCommand`'s `execute` method calls the broadcaster directly with the event name `log.entry` and the single log string as its payload. This ensures that crucial error information is displayed to the user with minimal delay.

### **3.3.2. Standard Logs: Batched Emission (`log.batch`)**

During a flush, the entire contents of the `logBuffer` are copied and sent as a single array in the payload of a `log.batch` event. Similarly, all pending progress updates in `progressBuffer` are sent as an array in a `progress.batch` event. After the data is copied for emission, the internal buffers are cleared, ready for the next batch.

## **3.4. Frontend-to-Backend Logging Loop and Prevention**

The system includes a mechanism for the frontend to send its own logs to the backend for unified logging (e.g., via `LoggingService.BackendLoggerBatch`). To prevent a feedback loop where these logs are then broadcast back to the frontend, a simple check is implemented in the `LogWriter`'s `Write` method. It parses the incoming JSON from `zerolog` and checks for an `"origin": "gui"` field. If this field is present, the log is not sent to the throttler, effectively breaking the loop.

# **4. Frontend Log Pipeline: From Reception to Storage**

Once log events are broadcast from the backend, the frontend pipeline takes over. Its primary responsibilities are to receive these events, process them into a consistent and chronologically accurate state, and make them available to the UI for rendering. This entire process is orchestrated by the `logStore`.

## **4.1. Log Entry Points: Backend Events and Frontend Logger**

The `logStore` receives log data from two primary sources:

1.  **Backend WebSocket Events:** The application's root component (`App.svelte`) initializes listeners for events broadcast by the backend. The key listeners are:
    *   `window.go.events.on("log-batch", (logBatch) => ...)`: This is the primary entry point for standard logs. It receives an array of log objects and passes them to `logStore.addLogBatch()`.
    *   `window.go.events.on("log.entry", (log) => ...)`: This listener handles critical, high-priority logs sent individually from the backend and passes them to `logStore.addLog()`.

2.  **Frontend Logger (`logger.ts`):** The application has its own frontend logger for capturing UI-specific events. To integrate these logs into the main viewer, the logger is configured with a callback. In `App.svelte`, `logger.registerLogViewerCallback(logStore.addLog)` directs any logs generated by the frontend logger into the same `logStore` pipeline, ensuring a unified log view.

## **4.2. The `logStore`: Central Hub for Log Management**

The `logStore` (`internal/gui/frontend/src/lib/logStore.ts`) is a Svelte writable store that serves as the single source of truth for all log data presented to the user. It is more than a simple array; it's an intelligent processing and state management system.

### **4.2.1. Asynchronous Batching (`pendingBatch`)**

To prevent the UI from re-rendering on every single log arrival, the `logStore` implements its own micro-batching mechanism. When `addLog` is called, it doesn't immediately update the main store. Instead, it pushes the formatted log into a temporary `pendingBatch` array.

A batch is processed (flushed to the main store) under one of two conditions:
*   **Time-based:** If more than 50ms has passed since the last log was added.
*   **Size-based:** If the `pendingBatch` grows to contain more than 10 logs.

If neither condition is met, a `setTimeout` schedules the processing to occur within 16ms, coalescing rapid, small updates into a single, efficient UI update.

### **4.2.2. The `mergeInsertLogs` Processing Core**

The heart of the `logStore` is the `processLogBatch` function, which calls `mergeInsertLogs`. This function is responsible for taking the new batch of logs and merging it into the existing, potentially very large, array of logs already in the store. Its most critical task is to ensure the final, combined array is perfectly sorted.

The `mergeInsertLogs` function is a wrapper that delegates the core logic to one of two implementations:
1.  **`mergeInsertLogsTS`:** A pure TypeScript implementation that performs an efficient merge of two sorted arrays.
2.  **WebAssembly Module:** A highly optimized Rust implementation of the same merge-sort logic.

### **4.2.3. Chronological Integrity: Sorting by Timestamp and Sequence**

Because logs can arrive from different sources (batched, direct, frontend-generated) and network timing is unpredictable, chronological order is not guaranteed upon arrival. The `mergeInsertLogs` function re-establishes this order by sorting logs based on two key metadata fields provided by the backend:

1.  **`_unix_time` (Primary Key):** A millisecond-precision Unix timestamp. This is the primary field used for sorting.
2.  **`_sequence` (Secondary Key):** A monotonically increasing integer assigned by the backend. This serves as a crucial tie-breaker for logs that occur within the same millisecond, guaranteeing stable and correct ordering.

This two-level sorting ensures that even in high-frequency logging scenarios, the final display is always chronologically accurate.

## **4.3. WebAssembly-Enhanced Performance**

For very large log volumes, sorting and merging thousands of logs in JavaScript can become a performance bottleneck. The system addresses this with a WebAssembly (Wasm) module written in Rust.

### **4.3.1. The Decision Engine: `shouldUseWasm`**

The `mergeInsertLogs` wrapper function does not blindly use Wasm. It first consults the `shouldUseWasm` utility (`internal/gui/frontend/src/lib/wasm.ts`). This function makes an intelligent, multi-factor decision:

*   **Global & Forced Settings:** It checks if Wasm is globally enabled in user settings (`useWasm`) and respects any forced mode (`forceWasmMode: 'enabled' | 'disabled'`).
*   **Log Volume Threshold:** It compares the total number of logs being processed against a configurable size threshold (`wasmSizeThreshold`, default: 500). Wasm is only considered for larger datasets where its performance benefits outweigh the overhead of data serialization.
*   **Memory Availability:** It calls `checkMemoryAvailability` to ensure there is enough memory in the Wasm heap to process the data, preventing out-of-memory errors and falling back to TypeScript if memory is constrained.
*   **Operation Blacklisting:** If a specific Wasm function has failed recently, it is temporarily "blacklisted" to prevent repeated errors, forcing a fallback to the TypeScript implementation.

### **4.3.2. Graceful Fallback and Error Handling**

The integration is designed for resilience. The call to the Wasm module is wrapped in a `try...catch` block. If any error occurs during Wasm execution (e.g., a serialization issue, a runtime error in the Rust code), the `handleWasmError` function is invoked. This function logs the error for diagnostics, may blacklist the operation, and, most importantly, allows the code to proceed to the pure TypeScript implementation (`mergeInsertLogsTS`). This ensures that even if the Wasm optimization fails, the logging functionality of the application is never compromised.

# **5. The `LogViewer` Component: Rendering, Interaction, and State Management**

The `LogViewer` (`internal/gui/frontend/src/components/LogViewer.svelte`) is the final destination for log data and the primary point of interaction for the user. It is a complex Svelte component engineered for performance, predictability, and user control. It subscribes to the `logStore` and reactively updates the display as new logs are processed.

## **5.1. Core Rendering Principle: `flex-direction: column-reverse`**

The `LogViewer` achieves its "terminal-like" behavior, where new content appears at the bottom and the scrollbar remains anchored to the top of the container, using the CSS property `flex-direction: column-reverse`. This has critical implications for its coordinate system:

*   **Visual vs. DOM Order:** The first log in the `filteredLogs` array is rendered at the bottom of the DOM but appears visually at the top of the scroll container. The newest log is added to the end of the array but appears visually at the bottom.
*   **Scroll Position (`scrollTop`):**
    *   `scrollTop = 0` corresponds to the **bottom** of the view, where the newest logs are visible.
    *   A positive `scrollTop` value means the user has scrolled **up** to view older logs.

All scroll position calculations within the component must account for this inverted coordinate system.

## **5.2. State Management: The Single Source of Truth**

To manage the complex interplay between automated scrolling and user interaction, the component relies on a set of clearly defined state variables.

### **5.2.1. The `autoScroll` Boolean and the `setAutoScroll` Controller**

The central state is a single boolean variable: `let autoScroll = true;`. This variable dictates the component's primary behavior:

*   **If `true`:** The viewer should automatically scroll to the bottom to show the newest logs as they arrive.
*   **If `false`:** The viewer should maintain its current scroll position, allowing the user to read older logs without interruption.

All changes to this state are funneled through a single controller function, `setAutoScroll(newValue, source)`. This function is the only piece of code allowed to modify the `autoScroll` variable. This centralized control prevents race conditions and makes state transitions explicit and debuggable. The `source` parameter provides context for why the state is changing (e.g., `'userScrollAway'`, `'userPreference'`).

### **5.2.2. Differentiating User vs. Programmatic Scrolls**

A key challenge is distinguishing between a scroll event triggered by the user (e.g., using the mouse wheel) and one triggered programmatically by the component itself (e.g., calling `scrollToBottom()`). The `LogViewer` solves this using a flag, `isProgrammaticScroll`.

Any function that programmatically changes `scrollTop` wraps the operation in the `withProgrammaticScroll()` helper. This helper sets `isProgrammaticScroll = true` just before the scroll operation and clears it asynchronously afterward. The main `handleScroll` event listener checks this flag at the very beginning and immediately exits if it's true, preventing programmatic scrolls from being misinterpreted as user actions.

### **5.2.3. State Flags for Robustness (`isUserScrolling`, `manualScrollLock`)**

Two additional flags provide finer control and prevent conflicts:

*   **`isUserScrolling`:** This flag is set to `true` immediately upon receiving a scroll event that is *not* programmatic. It is cleared by a debounced `setTimeout` in the scroll handler, indicating that the user's scroll gesture has ended. This flag prevents the Viewport Anchoring System from trying to restore a position while the user is actively moving the viewport.
*   **`manualScrollLock`:** This flag is set concurrently with `isUserScrolling` but is cleared on a much longer timer (e.g., 1.5 seconds). Its purpose is to prevent automated behaviors (like re-enabling `autoScroll` if the user scrolls back to the bottom) from occurring too quickly, giving the user time to read without the view state changing unexpectedly.

## **5.3. The Viewport Anchoring System (VAS)**

When `autoScroll` is `false`, the component must actively work to keep the user's view stable as new logs are added to the top of the DOM (visually appearing at the bottom). This mechanism is the Viewport Anchoring System (VAS).

1.  **Saving the Anchor (`saveViewportAnchor`):** Before the `logStore` processes a new batch of logs (which will alter the DOM and `scrollHeight`), the `LogViewer` saves an anchor. It identifies a log entry near the center of the current viewport and records its unique `_sequence` number and its pixel offset from the top of the viewport.
2.  **Restoring the Anchor (`restoreViewportAnchor`):** After the `logStore` update is complete and Svelte has updated the DOM, this function is called. It finds the previously anchored log entry by its `_sequence` number, calculates its new position in the updated layout, and programmatically adjusts the `scrollTop` to place that log back at its original pixel offset. This creates the illusion that the viewport is stationary while new content flows in below.

## **5.4. High-Performance Virtualization**

To handle tens of thousands of logs without crashing the browser, the `LogViewer` implements virtual rendering. When the number of logs exceeds a configurable threshold (`logViewerVirtualizationThreshold`), it switches from rendering every log to rendering only a small subset.

### **5.4.1. Concept: Rendering Only the Visible DOM Nodes**

Instead of rendering thousands of `<div>` elements, the `LogViewer` calculates which logs *should* be visible within the current scroll position. It then renders only that small window of logs (e.g., the visible logs plus a buffer of ~50 above and below). The massive, un-rendered space is simulated by two "spacer" divs at the top and bottom of the rendered content, whose heights are dynamically calculated to represent the total height of all the logs that are not currently in the DOM.

### **5.4.2. State and Calculations (`virtualStart`, `virtualEnd`, `avgLogHeight`)**

*   **`virtualStart` / `virtualEnd`:** These variables track the start and end indices of the log subset that is currently being rendered from the `filteredLogs` array.
*   **`avgLogHeight`:** The component maintains an average height for log entries, which is crucial for estimating the total scrollable height and the position of un-rendered logs. This value is continuously refined by measuring the actual rendered height of visible logs.
*   **`updateVirtualization()`:** This function is the core of the virtualization logic. It runs on every scroll event, calculating the new `virtualStart` and `virtualEnd` indices based on the current `scrollTop`, effectively sliding the small render window through the massive list of logs.

### **5.4.3. Adapting VAS for a Virtualized View**

When virtualization is active, the standard VAS (anchoring to a DOM element) becomes unreliable, as the anchor element may be removed from the DOM as the user scrolls. The system adapts by using an **index-based anchor**. Instead of a DOM element, it saves the *index* of the anchored log in the `filteredLogs` array. To restore the position, it calculates the estimated `scrollTop` that would bring that index back into view at the correct offset, using the `avgLogHeight` to estimate the position of the logs above it.
