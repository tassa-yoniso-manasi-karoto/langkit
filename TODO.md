- dynamic loading of list of STT providers in the frontend
- use selective translit tokenized inside TRANSLIT.GO
- valid browser URL required even for Subs2Cards alone
- fix progress bar yellow/red on abort without transition
- bug in TH2EN
- banner in subs2cards for dub as source when Dubtitles are selected too

- GUI options:
  - condensed audio toggle
  - dubs allow user to request cached sep voice file deletion
  
- fix sweep animation covering only 60% of the progressbar
- coffee icon

- ðŸ¤¯ consistent progress bars between GUI and CLI
  - sub line count
  - processedCount for ETA calculation
  - ETA algo bc progressbar pkg uses a rate-based on few past seconds to make an ETA and it is garbage when tasks are CPU bound + massive task pool

- truncated feature card (left & right) when not maximized, buttons process and cancel too

- support Condensed Audio summaries

- manual GUI tests
- manual CLI tests
- try offline to see if icon / fonts are missing
- clean run in VirtualBox


- fix newlines in builtin documentation
- Browse / check FIXMEs in codebase


*future implementations*

- implement an explicit maxAbortTasks
- add progressCallback to all providers in translitkit including go-natives

- hard limiter for workers num when making dubtitles from remote API (otherwise too many requests may induce delays and trigger timeouts)
- ideally, scraper-providers should have exponential backoff both in timing and in their chunks' sizes

- word freq lists

*might:*

- with [libvips binding](https://github.com/h2non/bimg) or imagor: fuzz trim to remove black padding if ratio is different => REQUIRE LIBS TO BE INSTALLED
- use Enhanced voice audiotrack as basis for audio clips
- use lower bitrate opus with DRED & LBRR that were just standardized [1](https://opus-codec.org/),[2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mlcodec-opus-extension/)
- lossless AVIF extraction from AV1 (HQ but worst than JPEG in size)
