# Preliminary Design Specification: LogViewer Scrolling System with flex-direction: column-reverse CSS property

## 1. Core Design Principles

### 1.1 Guiding Values
- **User Control Primacy**: User-initiated actions must always take precedence over automated behaviors
- **Predictable Behavior**: The system should behave consistently across browsers and user scenarios
- **Visual Stability**: Content should not unexpectedly shift or jump during user reading
- **Performance Efficiency**: Implementation must remain responsive even with large log volumes
- **Graceful Degradation**: The system should maintain core functionality across browsers and edge cases

### 1.2 Architectural Philosophy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Leverage native browser behaviors where reliable, implement explicit controls where needed
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly delineate between auto-scroll logic, viewport anchoring, and user input handling
- **Defensive Implementation**: Anticipate and gracefully handle race conditions, rapid state changes, and edge cases
- **Clear State Management**: Maintain unambiguous internal state that accurately reflects the visual representation

## 2. System Components & Relationships

### 2.1 Core Conceptual Model
- **Auto-Scroll Mode**: A binary state determining whether the view should automatically follow newest logs
- **Viewport Anchoring System (VAS)**: A position preservation mechanism that maintains stable viewing experience
- **Scroll Event Management**: A system for differentiating between user and programmatic scroll events
- **Virtualization Integration**: Specialized behavior modifications when dealing with virtualized content

### 2.2 State Management Architecture
- **Primary Control State**: `autoScroll` boolean - the single source of truth for tracking mode
- **Internal Operational Flags**:
  - User interaction tracking (e.g., active scrolling, programmatic operations)
  - Measurement and calculation coordination
  - Position anchoring data structures
  - Timing and debounce controls

### 2.3 System Interactions & Dependencies
- **UI → State**: User interactions with checkbox directly affect the `autoScroll` state
- **State → Behavior**: `autoScroll` state determines whether VAS is active and how scroll positions are maintained
- **Logs → Position**: Log additions trigger a position preservation flow depending on `autoScroll` state
- **Events → Flags**: Scroll, resize, and other events modify internal flags to coordinate behaviors

## 3. Detailed Behavioral Specifications

### 3.1 Auto-Scroll State Transitions

#### 3.1.1 User-Initiated Mode Changes (Checkbox Toggle)
- **OFF → ON**:
  - VAS must be immediately disabled
  - Any current viewport anchor must be discarded
  - If not already at the bottom, an explicit programmatic scroll must move view to bottom
  - Subsequent log additions should maintain bottom position (primarily through browser behavior)
  - This transition should feel responsive and immediate to the user

- **ON → OFF**:
  - VAS must be immediately enabled
  - Current viewport position must be captured as anchor reference
  - Subsequent log additions must preserve the anchored position
  - No automatic scrolling should occur while in this state

#### 3.1.2 Implicit State Changes (User Scrolling)
- **ON → OFF (Automatic)**:
  - When user scrolls away from bottom with auto-scroll ON, the system must:
    - Automatically transition to auto-scroll OFF
    - Enable VAS and capture the new position
    - Provide subtle visual feedback that auto-scroll has been disabled
    - Ensure checkbox UI reflects the new state

- **OFF → ON (Optional Consideration)**:
  - When user manually scrolls to bottom with auto-scroll OFF:
    - *Option 1*: Maintain OFF state (requires explicit user checkbox action)
    - *Option 2*: Automatically re-enable auto-scroll (more automated but potentially unexpected)
    - Design recommendation: Implement Option 1 for predictability, with clear visual cues to re-enable

### 3.2 Viewport Anchoring System (VAS) Behavior

#### 3.2.1 Fundamental Operation
- **When Active**: Only when auto-scroll is OFF
- **Purpose**: Maintain stable viewing position during log additions and container changes
- **Core Process**:
  1. Before DOM updates: Capture position reference relative to a stable element
  2. After DOM updates: Calculate new position and restore viewport to equivalent position
  3. Apply position preservation only when appropriate (not during user scrolling)

#### 3.2.2 Anchor Selection Strategy
- **Primary Strategy**: Anchor to visible log entry near viewport center
- **Alternative Strategy**: Use scroll percentage or offset from top/bottom when specific elements aren't reliable
- **Fallback Mechanism**: When anchor elements are removed (filtering, virtualization), recalculate based on nearby elements

#### 3.2.3 Coordinate Calculations
- **Column-Reverse Transformation**: All position calculations must account for inverted coordinate system
- **Precision Considerations**: Use tolerance values (±1-2px) for position comparisons to account for rounding and subpixel rendering
- **Boundary Handling**: Ensure calculated positions remain within valid scroll range, particularly near content boundaries

### 3.3 Log Update & Rendering Flow

#### 3.3.1 With Auto-Scroll ON
- **Expected Behavior**: View remains at newest logs (bottom)
- **Primary Mechanism**: Browser's natural tendency to maintain scrollTop=0 in column-reverse layout
- **Safety Mechanism**: Explicit scrollTop=0 enforcement after updates when necessary, particularly:
  - After filtering operations
  - With virtualization enabled
  - After significant layout changes
  - Following browser inconsistencies

#### 3.3.2 With Auto-Scroll OFF
- **Expected Behavior**: View maintains stable position relative to existing content
- **Primary Mechanism**: VAS captures position before update, restores equivalent position after
- **Critical Timing**: Position restoration must occur after DOM updates are complete (Svelte tick)
- **Interference Prevention**: Skip position restoration during active user scrolling

## 4. Event Handling & Coordination

### 4.1 Scroll Event Management

#### 4.1.1 Event Categorization
- **User-Initiated Scrolling**: Direct interaction requiring state changes
- **Programmatic Scrolling**: System-initiated scroll requiring exclusion from feedback loops
- **Momentum/Inertial Scrolling**: Post-interaction scrolling requiring special timing considerations

#### 4.1.2 Scroll Cycle Behavior
- **Start**: Mark active scrolling, prevent competing operations
- **During**: Update internal state, track direction and extent
- **End (Debounced)**: Re-enable normal operations, evaluate position for potential state changes
- **Threshold Values**: Use small tolerance (1px) for "at bottom" detection to account for precision issues

### 4.2 Resize Event Handling
- **Container Resizing**: Recalculate dimensions and maintain appropriate scroll position
- **Window Resizing**: Adjust virtualization parameters while preserving view stability
- **Content Height Changes**: Recalculate total height and adjust scroll position proportionally

### 4.3 DOM Lifecycle Integration
- **Before DOM Updates**: Capture position references
- **After DOM Updates**: Apply position restoration only after rendering complete
- **Batched Operations**: Group multiple operations to reduce performance impact

## 5. Edge Cases & Robustness Measures

### 5.1 Race Conditions & Timing Issues

#### 5.1.1 Rapid Interaction Sequences
- **Rapid Checkbox Toggling**: Deduplicate closely-timed transitions, honor latest user intent
- **Scrolling During Transitions**: Prioritize direct user interaction, cancel competing operations
- **Updates During Scrolling**: Delay position-affecting operations until scrolling stabilizes
- **Concurrent Operations**: Establish clear operation precedence hierarchy with user actions at highest priority

#### 5.1.2 Animation & Transition Timing
- **CSS Transitions**: Account for active transitions when calculating positions
- **Svelte Animations**: Ensure animations complete before applying critical position logic
- **Browser Painting**: Allow sufficient time between measurement and positioning (requestAnimationFrame)

### 5.2 Initialization & Edge States

#### 5.2.1 Component Initialization
- **Initial Rendering**: Establish default auto-scroll state (ON recommended)
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Handle gracefully when logs arrive after initial render
- **Empty State**: Manage properly when log container starts empty
- **Cold Start**: Apply default behaviors before user has expressed preference

#### 5.2.2 Focus & Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Maintain expected behavior with keyboard scrolling
- **Screen Readers**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and focus management
- **Tab Visibility**: Handle background tab updates appropriately

### 5.3 Browser & Environment Variations

#### 5.3.1 Browser-Specific Behaviors
- **Scroll Position Maintenance**: Some browsers may handle column-reverse differently
- **Event Timing**: Different browsers have different event ordering for scroll, resize
- **Rendering Optimizations**: Account for browser-specific layout and paint timing

#### 5.3.2 Performance Degradation Scenarios
- **Large Log Volumes**: Maintain responsiveness with thousands of entries
- **Limited Resources**: Degrade gracefully on low-power devices
- **Slow Connections**: Handle properly when logs arrive in bursts

## 6. Feature Integration Specifications

### 6.1 Virtualization Compatibility

#### 6.1.1 Auto-Scroll with Virtualization
- **Scroll Position Management**: Explicit bottom positioning required after virtualization updates
- **Render Window Adjustment**: Ensure newest logs are within virtual window when auto-scroll ON
- **Performance Considerations**: Minimize layout thrashing during rapid updates

#### 6.1.2 VAS with Virtualization
- **Anchor Strategy Adaptation**: Use index-based anchoring rather than DOM elements
- **Calculations Adjustment**: Account for virtual content that doesn't exist in DOM
- **Position Estimation**: Handle gracefully when exact positions cannot be determined

### 6.2 Log Filtering & Manipulation

#### 6.2.1 Filter Application
- **Position Handling**: Re-evaluate scroll position after filter changes
- **Auto-Scroll Behavior**: Maintain current auto-scroll state through filter operations
- **Anchor Invalidation**: Reset anchors that may no longer be valid after filtering

#### 6.2.2 Log Truncation & Clearing
- **State Preservation**: Maintain auto-scroll setting through content clearing
- **Position Recalculation**: Adjust scroll position when logs are truncated
- **Empty State Handling**: Manage gracefully when all logs are cleared/filtered

## 9. Implementation Risks & Mitigations

### 9.1 Known Risks

#### 9.1.1 Browser Behavior Reliance
- **Risk**: Different browsers handle column-reverse and scrollTop=0 maintenance differently
- **Mitigation**: Implement explicit position enforcement where browser behavior is unreliable
- **Fallback**: Provide configurable behavior when default approach doesn't work

#### 9.1.2 Performance Bottlenecks
- **Risk**: Position calculations could become expensive with large log volumes
- **Mitigation**: Optimize calculations, batch operations, consider virtualization
- **Monitoring**: Implement performance tracking to identify degradation

#### 9.1.3 Complex State Management
- **Risk**: Multiple interacting systems could create unexpected behavior
- **Mitigation**: Clear ownership of state changes, rigorous testing of state transitions
- **Simplification**: Reduce state variables where possible, enforce single-source-of-truth

### 9.2 Open Questions & Decisions

#### 9.2.1 Architectural Decisions
- Should auto-scroll be re-enabled automatically when user scrolls to bottom?
- How aggressive should the system be in enforcing scrollTop=0 with auto-scroll ON?
- Should scroll position be preserved across component remounts?

#### 9.2.2 Performance Tradeoffs
- What is the appropriate balance between smooth animations and performance?
