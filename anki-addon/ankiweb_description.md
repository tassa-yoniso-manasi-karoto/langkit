## Key Features

Langkit is not so much an addon but really more of **an actual app that can be run within Anki.**

Hence its top features are not related to, but complementary to Anki:

- **Voice Enhancement**: Amplifies dialogue over background music & effects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ Helpful when speech is hard to hear, common in series recorded on location rather than in a studio

- **Dubtitles**: Generates accurate subtitles from dubbed audio using speech-to-text<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ Useful when you want subtitles that match exactly what's being said

- **Script Romanization**: Converts Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Russian, etc. into phonetic text<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ For learners who understand speech but can't or don't want to read the script

- **Selective Kanji**: Show only the kanji you know, convert the rest to hiragana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ Learn kanji progressively by only displaying ones at your level

- **Condensed Audio**: Generate an abridged audio file containing only the dialogue from media<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ Great for listening practice during commutes or chores

- **Card Creation for Anki**: Modern subs2cards with OPUS audio & AVIF images (50-70% smaller than MP3 & JPEG)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⤷ Build a vocabulary deck from your favorite shows through sentence mining

[Features' documentation and how to make the most of Langkit is explained in detail on the Github page.](https://github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/langkit)
